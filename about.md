I am a researcher and writer interested in neuroscience, technology, healthcare, privacy, language and music, among other things. See my [projects](https://hdbhdb.github.io/projects/) for more details about my research interests. I am a graduate from the University of Chicago (MA) and Oberlin College (BA). 


## About this site

This site is based on the [Lanyon theme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), both of which are open-source. Jekyll is a great and far more flexible alternative to something like Google Pages or Wordpress. This site is hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Because this site built from a GitHub repository, if you have suggestions or questions about any content on this site, you can open an issue or pull request on the [repo for this site](https://github.com/hdbhdb/hdbhdb.github.io).
