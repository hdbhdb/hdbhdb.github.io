title: Digital Psychiatry

As psychiatrists begin to implement digital surveillance technologies in routine patient care, they must grapple with new sorts of issues in patient trust and information security. These anticipated changes in mental health care will deploy large-scale information infrastructure from global technology and telecommunications companies (e.g., cloud services, iOS and Google developer platforms) in order to help facilitate psychiatric treatments, mental health assessments and clinical psychiatric research on an unprecedented scale. Beyond the basic security risks of relying on complex data ecosystems to transmit sensitive patient information about mental health and illness, these new technologies also present a new set of trust issues amongst patients, physicians and the vast technical systems which might mediate future patient-physician relationships. 

My research in psychiatry's technology development has so far focused on how cultural anxieties about invasive information collection and speculative neuro-technologies become entangled in questions of clinical ethics, new dimensions of psychiatric symptomology, and the construction of information infrastructure itself. I charted how these informatic futures were articulated in efforts to design and develop patient monitoring technologies in collaborations that assembled physicians, computer programmers, bioengineers, research neuroscientists and venture capitalists, among others. Over the course of several months of research at a single neuro-psychiatry laboratory, I observed the progress of mobile app development project as well as formal and informal discussions ranging from neuro-informatics, patient metadata systems and machine learning statistical analysis, to ethics, measurements for mental illness, physician anxieties about digital surveillance, and emerging cultural models of public health entrepreneurship. I brought these discussions into a broader narrative about the relationship between mental health, technology and society, as well as the various cultural pressures for introducing automation technologies and technological "black boxes" into an imagined information infrastructure that might be oriented toward care.
