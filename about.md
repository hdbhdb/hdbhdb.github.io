You are at the website and blog of Hudson Diggs Bailey. I am a researcher and writer interested in culture, brains, technology, healthcare and privacy. My [resume](/assets/bailey_resume.pdf) has more details on my background and past projects. [Projects](/projects) lists current projects. If you have questions or wish to contact me, send an email to _my full name_, no punctuation, @ g mail.

## About this site

This site is based on the [Lanyon theme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), both of which are open-source. The site is hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). For simple websites and blogs, Jekyll and GitHub Pages are great and arguably more flexible alternative to something like Google Pages or Wordpress which primarily rely on advertising revenue to create free web hosting for their users. More information on open-source blogging and webhosting can be found at [my Github repo](https://github.com/hdbhdb/hdbhdb.github.io).

This site is actually _built_ from my GitHub repository, so if you have suggestions about anything on this site, in addition to contacting me via email, you can open an issue or pull request on [the repo for this site](https://github.com/hdbhdb/hdbhdb.github.io).
