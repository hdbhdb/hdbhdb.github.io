I am a researcher and writer working on several interdisciplinary issues in cultural anthropology and science and technology studies. Most generally, my work focuses on life sciences and technological innovation in a cross-cultural context and aims to contribute to discussions in technology policy and law. Here are a few of my research projects.

### Interfaced Affects
An ongoing project on the politics and design ethics of digital technologies in psychiatry. My work has focused on the development of surveillance technologies where mental health is a primary concern. What stakes does digital medicine (i.e., telemedicine, mHealth, self-tracking) have in transforming digital infrastructures more broadly? How do machine learning  and digital interfaces alter the framing of mental health?

### Soundscapes and Surveillance
Ongoing project exploring the relationship between canonical city music-scapes (especially jazz and punk) and the surveillance of the sonic urban environment. Began as part of an artist residency (February - August 2016) at the No Nation Art Gallery in Chicago.

### And Your Bird Can Sing
Research project on the use of songbirds as a translational model for human language. This project focused concretely on transcription and notation practices of ornithologists and then historically on the relationship between the study of birdsong and the symbolism of birds in a Euro-American scientific, humanist and lay context. How has birdsong been made into a plausible model for understanding human language qua verbal communication, and for understanding so called "universal grammars" qua the neurobiology of bird auditory processing?

### Multisensory Integration in Immersive Virtual Environments
I did my undergraduate in neuroscience where I worked in a human behavioral neuroscience lab. I worked on an Oculus Rift virtual reality study to bridge earlier findings in multisensory neuroscience with how we might actually sense things in the real world. We found some interesting patterns that suggested some ways that simple computer interfaces may have influenced our understanding of the relationships between sensory modalities.
