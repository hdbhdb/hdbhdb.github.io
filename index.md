## About this site

This site is based on the [Lanyon theme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), both of which are open-source. The site is hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). For simple websites and blogs, Jekyll and GitHub Pages are great and arguably more flexible alternative to something like Google Pages or Wordpress which primarily rely on advertising revenue to create free web hosting for their users. You can find more information on open-source blogging and web-hosting by clicking through links on [my Github page](https://github.com/hdbhdb/).

This site is actually _built_ from a GitHub repository, so if you have questions about anything on this site, in addition to contacting me via email, you can check out [the repo for this site](https://github.com/hdbhdb/hdbhdb.github.io) or even open an issue or pull request.
