As psychiatrists begin to implement digital and platform technologies in routine patient care, they must grapple with new sorts of issues in patient trust and information security. These anticipated changes in mental health care will deploy cutting-edge information infrastructure in order to help facilitate psychiatric treatments, mental health assessments and clinical psychiatric research on an unprecedented scale. 

Beyond the information security risks of relying on new data ecosystems to transmit sensitive patient information about mental health and illness, these technologies also present a new set of trust issues amongst patients, physicians and information systems. My ethnographic research in this area explored the relationships between mental health issues and the user experience of psychiatric technology.
