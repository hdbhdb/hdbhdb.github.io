Psychiatry has a long and complex history in the United State, and despite the nearly 60-year reign of the DSM, competing approaches of interpretation and treatment continue to exist. New ways of using computers to measure mood and affect now play a significant role in the development and standardization of psychiatric practice and in the ongoing work of defining mental health and illness. These anticipated changes in mental health care[^1] will utilize advancements in information technology in order to help facilitate psychiatric treatments, mental health assessments and clinical psychiatric research on an unprecedented scale. However, as psychiatrists begin to implement these computational technologies in patient care, they must grapple with new sorts of challenges related to patient information. These challenges have several related dimensions: a) the design of technical systems, b) HIPAA compliance, c) disorder classifications, d) physician-patient relationships, and e) clinical efficacy. 

For my Masters thesis project, I conducted several months of ethnographic research which was centered on a neuropsychiatry lab and a mobile app development project. My role as an independent researcher was to document and analyze various challenges surrounding the implementation of computational psychiatric techniques (i.e., "digital phenotyping")[^2], and develop contextual inquiry for patient and public reception. Ultimately, the feasibility and clinical efficacy of these digital tools rests on how they are understood by patients and the ways in which they do or do not conform to broader notions of "technology", "personal health information", or "surveillance".

The conclusions of my research took a particular interest in the institutional and professional contexts surrounding technology development. How does the setting in which technology development happens affect the technologies that are produced? How can institutional and/or regulatory structures be designed to facilitate the design of optimally secure, compliant and, moreover, trusted information systems?
