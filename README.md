## About the site

This blog is made from open source software. The structure of the site comes from the [Lanyon theme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), both of which are open-source. The site itself is hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Jekyll and GitHub Pages are great for simple websites and arguably more flexible and modifiable alternative to something like Google Pages or Wordpress. Other free hosting services, like Google and Wordpress, primarily rely on advertising revenue--so Jekyll is a great alternative if you do not want to support advertising industry-fueled technology and web development with your own site. Making a webpage with Jekyll does require some knowledge of text editors, installation dependencies and code repositories. There is great documentation to walk you through each of these steps, so even someone with relatively little programming background and a bit of spare time should be able to get a freely-hosted open-source webpage up and running.

From [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/):
  >Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

From [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#lanyon):
  >Lanyon is an unassuming Jekyll theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on Poole, the Jekyll butler... Lanyon is a theme built on top of Poole, which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setupâ€”just download and start the Jekyll server.
