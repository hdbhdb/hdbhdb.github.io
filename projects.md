I am a cross-disciplinary researcher working in anthropology and science and technology studies. My work focuses on neuroscience and biomedical innovation in culture and aims to contribute to discussions in technology policy and law. Here are a few of my research projects. 

## Interfaced Affects
An ongoing project on the ethics and politics of digital technologies in psychiatry. My work has focused on the development of surveillance technologies where (mental) health is a primary concern. What stakes does digital medicine (e.g., telemedicine, mHealth, self-tracking) have in transforming digital infrastructures more broadly?

## Soundscapes and Surveillance
Ongoing project exploring the relationship between canonical city soundscapes (esp. jazz and punk musics) and the surveillance of the sonic environments of urban environments. Began as part of an artist residency (February - August 2016) at the No Nation Art Gallery in Chicago.

## And Your Bird Can Sing
Research project began as undergraduate on the use of songbirds as a translational model for human language in neurobiology. This project focuses concretely on transcription practices of ornithologists and more historically on the relationship between the study of bird song and the symbolism of birds. How and why does birdsong get made into a plausible model for understanding human language qua verbal communication?

## Multisensory Integration in Immersive Virtual Environments
I did my undergraduate in neuroscience and worked in a human behavioral neuroscience lab. I worked on an Oculus Rift virtual reality study to bridge earlier findings in [multisensory neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisensory_integration) with how we sense things in the real world. We found some interesting patterns that suggested that simple interfaces may have influenced our understanding of the relationships between sensory modalities.
