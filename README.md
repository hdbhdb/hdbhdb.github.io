## About the site

From [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/):
  >Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

From [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#lanyon):
  >Lanyon is an unassuming Jekyll theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on Poole, the Jekyll butler... Lanyon is a theme built on top of Poole, which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setupâ€”just download and start the Jekyll server.
