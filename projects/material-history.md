Quantified Self has demonstrated the power of deploying data for self-knowledge with an experimentalist ethos. In some cases "self-tracking" as such is not an introduction of quantification to a place that it had been absent, but rather a process of re-encoding, a distinct data ecology, a novel array of metrics and measurements. *Re-quantification* can be simply understood to mean that the informatic sensorium has varied political affordances.

Recording lists of urls you have visited is not the only way to record your browsing history. For one, this is not how the web's pervasive tracking cookies read out where you have been previously and predict where you are likely to go. What does it mean for computers to read history differently from how humans read history (e.g., simple visual lists of urls chunked by date, or panels displayed blank web browser tabs)? Moreover, what abuses and opportunities does the discrepancy in human and computer representation open up for doing unexpected things with data?

Representations of both data and history are not inevitable but neither are they arbitrary. History (browsing or otherwise), of course, does not really take place in discrete, itemized events. Other heuristics for personal data histories are possible, as are different ways of experimenting with the way history is visually or otherwise represented. By experimenting with different material representations of history, with different modalities of "procedural rhetoric", perhaps we can get closer to understanding what our paths through the internet might mean.

Material Browsing History aims to be a series of experiments in re-quantifying web browsing data.
