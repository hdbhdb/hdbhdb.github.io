title: Design Ethics for Digital Psychiatry

As psychiatrists and other medical professionals begin to implement digital technologies in routine patient care, patients are exposed to novel privacy risks. Beyond the security risk of relying solely on digital infrastructure and cloud-based services for storing information related to psychiatric symptoms and mental health, these new technologies also present new set of trust issues amongst patients, physicians and the technology which mediates these patient-physician relationships. My ethnographic research in medical technology development showed how _perceived_ invasive information collection risks affecting patient trust, physician credibility and perhaps the viability of using new digital technologies for patient care. **Design ethics** are essential to differentiating these patient-care platforms from other patient associations with other technology platforms and to promoting the success of patients' mental health as well as the success physician-led entrepreneurship.

Guided by current critical discussions in social theory, I worked directly with psychiatrists and computer scientists to develop a patient-centered understanding of monitoring algorithms and digital health platforms. I addressed these nuanced problems using a combination of ethnographic research methods including participant observation and semi-structured interviews with computer scientists, neuroscientists and physicians. Over the course of several months of research, these conversations and observations narrowed-down to a set of important distinctions between how developers and physicians saw highly technical problems and solutions differently in their collaborations with each other. The topics of these discussions ranged from neuro-informatics and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to clinical ethics frameworks, the nature of symptoms of mental illness, anxieties about digital surveillance, and emerging models of public health entrepreneurship.

My research ultimately aimed to uncover the aspirations and systemic setbacks in clinical and diagnostic technologies designed by physicians and developed in collaborations with computer programmers, engineers, research neuroscientists and others. I showed how psychiatrists and other professionals in this field are confronted with the strange banality that we currently have the information technologies that could prevent tragedy in patients' lives, but that the fear of liability and a general distrust of corporate technology often undermines the possibility of applying them to clinical settings. My thesis brought these discussions into a broader narrative about the relationship between public mental health, the role of technology in society and the various social and economic pressures for technological innovation in healthcare. My research showed that implementing systems-level design solutions can require revisiting back-end development, data ecosystems, social perceptions of surveillance and other non-visible elements apart from the interface itself, all of which can strongly affect both patient and physician experiences with monitoring technology and digital interfaces.

My research culminated in a Masterâ€™s thesis in cultural anthropology which presented a novel argument about 1) situating design ethics in technology development and 2) effectively advocating for vulnerable populations as niche digital platforms evolve in the medical and healthcare sectors.
