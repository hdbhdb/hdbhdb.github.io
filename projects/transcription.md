title: Visualizing Non-Verbal Interactions in Transcription Design
layout: no-sidebar-page

Transcription is an important part of documenting and analyzing all kinds of human-centered research. However, transcripts that focus exclusively on spoken language can often erase salient elements of the interactions that they are trying to represent. As part of an undergraduate linguistic anthropology course on nonverbal communication, I developed a transcription approach for fixed camera video that preserves many features of nonverbal interaction that are difficult to document with classic transcription styles such as body language, gestures, prosody or camera actions. A transcript will always have selection bias in order to focus attention on interesting aspects of an interaction, but my research showed that in some cases these aspects will not necessarily be the speech or language of the participants. The best kind of transcript might not read like a play or novel. Transcription is always an experiment with ways of transforming, reducing and presenting information,[^1] so why not approach transcription design experimentally?

While transcription methodology is a very central question in linguistic anthropology, it also has important implications in any realm of qualitative research where nonverbal interactions are important, from ethnography to content analysis to interviews. Though multimedia technologies can offer increasingly granular analyses of interactions via video or interactive web-based formats, paper (or static document formats) remains widely-used in many stages of research and publication. For everything from academic publishing to product testing cycles in user research to research briefs, the question of how to best represent fluid interaction on a paper(-like) medium continues to persist.

I used extensive secondary research to find patterns in potential ambiguity and omissions in published transcripts related to scientific discourse. My process to address some of these biases and representional problems involved creating simple sketches of interactions and transcription templates. Each template highlighted different aspects of a social interaction that could be useful for different researchers under different contexts.

I developed a prototype transcript using simple layout tools in MS Word. This prototype focused on power dynamics in scientists' informal research discussions and was submitted as part of a final semester-long project in linguistic anthropology.

This project resulted in a multi-purpose columns-style transcription template that can be deployed in any type of research that is interested in the aspects of interactions which are rendered invisible in other sorts of transcripts.

I am currently refining a more modular, open-source version of the template via ShareLaTeX.
