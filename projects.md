This page lists current projects I am actively researching and writing on. If you are interested in past projects, see my [CV](/assets/bailey_CV.pdf).

### Interfaced Affects
**...** on the politics and design ethics of digital technologies in psychiatry. By looking at the entrepreneurial development of surveillance technologies where improving mental health is the primary objective, my work asks what stakes digital medicine and physicians' ethical frameworks has in transforming digital infrastructures more broadly.

### Soundscapes, Surveillance & Sonic Fictions
**...** on the relationship between some canonical city music-scapes (e.g., jazz and punk) and the surveillance of the sonic urban environment. Began as part of an artist residency (2/16-8/16) at the No Nation Art Gallery in Chicago.

### And Your Bird Can Sing
**...** on the use of songbirds as a translational model for human language in neurobiology. This focuses _in situ_ on transcription and notation practices of ornithologists and then historically on the relationship between the study of birdsong and the symbolism of birds in a Euro-American scientific and lay context. I ask how has birdsong been made into a plausible model for understanding human language qua verbal communication.
