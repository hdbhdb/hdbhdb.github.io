## About this site

This site is based on the [Lanyon theme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), both of which are open-source. The site is hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and is built from code held in a GitHub repository. If you have questions about anything here, in addition to contacting me via email, you can check out [the repo for this site](https://github.com/hdbhdb/hdbhdb.github.io).
