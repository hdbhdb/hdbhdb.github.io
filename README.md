## About the site

This blog is made from open source software. The structure of the site comes from [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) which is a theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Both Jekyll and Lanyon are open-source. This site itself is hosted for free via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Jekyll + GitHub Pages is great for simple websites and is arguably a more flexible and modifiable alternative to something like Google Pages or Wordpress. Other free hosting services, like Google and Wordpress, primarily rely on advertising revenue to create free web-hosting. Since GitHub has never been funded by advertising, Jekyll + GitHub Pages is a great alternative if you do not want to support advertising industry-fueled technology and web development with your own site. Making a webpage with Jekyll does require some knowledge of text editors, the command line interface and code repositories. There is great documentation to walk you through each of these steps, so even someone with relatively little computer skills and a bit of spare time should be able to get a freely-hosted open-source site or blog up and running.

From [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll#philosophy):
  >Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity... Jekyll does what you tell it to do — no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration.



From [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#lanyon):
  >Lanyon is an unassuming Jekyll theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on Poole, the Jekyll butler... Lanyon is a theme built on top of Poole, which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup—just download and start the Jekyll server.
