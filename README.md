## About the site
This site is based on the Lanyon theme for Jekyll, both of which are open-source. Jekyll is a great and far more flexible alternative to something like Google Pages or Wordpress.

From [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/):
  >Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

From [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#lanyon):
  >Lanyon is an unassuming Jekyll theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on Poole, the Jekyll butler... Lanyon is a theme built on top of Poole, which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup—just download and start the Jekyll server.
