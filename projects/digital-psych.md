title: Design Ethics for Digital Psychiatry

As psychiatrists and other medical professionals begin to implement digital technology in routine patient care, psychiatric patients are exposed to novel privacy risks. In addition to the security risk of relying on digital infrastructure and cloud-based services for storing information related to psychiatric diagnoses and mental health, these new technologies also present new set of trust issues between patients, physicians and technology. Any invasive information collection risks affecting patient trust, physician credibility and even the viability of these new digital platforms for patient care. Design ethics are essential to differentiating these platforms from surveillance and to promoting the success of both psychiatric patients and entrepreneurial physicians.

Advised by cultural anthropologists, I worked directly with psychiatrists and computer scientists to develop an ethics-centered approach to psychiatric monitoring technology. I addressed these problems with wide-ranging User Research, specifically participant observation and one-on-one semi-structured interviews with computer scientists, neuroscientists and physicians. Over the course of several months, these conversations narrowed down to a set of important distinctions between how developers and physicians saw highly technical problems and solutions differently.

My research explored both aspirations and systemic setbacks in clinical and diagnostic products designed by physicians and intended to genuinely help people. I focused on how implementing design solutions can require revisiting back-end development, data ecosystems, perceptions of surveillance and other non-visible elements which strongly affect a patient’s experience with monitoring technology and digital interfaces.

My work culminated in a Master’s thesis in cultural anthropology which presented a novel argument about situating ethics in technology development and effective advocating for vulnerable populations as niche digital platforms evolve in the medical and healthcare sectors.
