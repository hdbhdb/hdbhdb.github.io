## About the site
This site is based on the Lanyon theme for Jekyll, both of which are open-source. Jekyll is a great and far more flexible alternative to something like Google Pages or Wordpress.


From Lanyon:
  >Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
  Lanyon is a theme built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setupâ€”just download and start the Jekyll server.

If you have suggestions or questions about any content, you can open an issue or pull request.
