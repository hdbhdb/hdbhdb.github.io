title: Design Ethics for Digital Psychiatry

As psychiatrists and other medical professionals begin to implement digital technology in routine patient care, psychiatric patients are exposed to novel privacy risks. In addition to the security risk of relying on digital infrastructure and cloud-based services for storing information related to psychiatric diagnoses and mental health, these new technologies also present new set of trust issues amongst patients, physicians and the technology which mediates their relationships. Any _perceived_ invasive information collection risks affecting patient trust, physician credibility and even the viability of these new digital technologies for patient care. Design ethics are essential to differentiating these platforms from other associations with technology platforms and to promoting the success of both psychiatric patients and entrepreneurial physicians.

Advised by cultural anthropologists, I worked directly with psychiatrists and computer scientists to develop an ethics-centered understanding to psychiatric monitoring technology. I addressed these problems with participant observation as well as one-on-one semi-structured interviews with computer scientists, neuroscientists and physicians. Over the course of several months, these conversations narrowed down to a set of important distinctions between how developers and physicians saw highly technical problems and solutions differently. The topics of these discussions ranged from neuro-informatics and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to clinical ethics frameworks, anxieties about ubiquitous surveillance, and physicians’ complicated transitions to entrepreneurship.

My research explored the aspirations and systemic setbacks in clinical and diagnostic technologies designed by physicians and developed in collaborations with developers, neuroscientists and more. Psychiatrists in this field are confronted with the strange banality that the information technologies that could prevent tragedy already exist, but that surveillance, misuse of personal data, and general distrust of corporate technology entirely undermines the possibility of applying them to clinical applications. My thesis brought these discussions into a broader narrative about the relationship between public mental health and various pressures for technological innovation in healthcare. Implementing design solutions can require revisiting back-end development, data ecosystems, perceptions of surveillance and other non-visible elements apart from the interface which can strongly affect a patient’s experience with monitoring technology and digital interfaces.

My work culminated in a Master’s thesis in cultural anthropology which presented a novel argument about situating ethics in technology development and effective advocating for vulnerable populations as niche digital platforms evolve in the medical and healthcare sectors.
