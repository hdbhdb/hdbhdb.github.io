## About the site

My site is hosted for free via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The basic structure of the site comes from the [Lanyon theme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

From [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll#philosophy):
  >Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity... Jekyll does what you tell it to do — no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration.

From [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#lanyon):
  >Lanyon is an unassuming Jekyll theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on Poole, the Jekyll butler... Lanyon is a theme built on top of Poole, which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup—just download and start the Jekyll server.
